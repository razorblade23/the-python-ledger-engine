2. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repo and clone it locally.
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Run Locally:** Use `npm start` to see your changes in real-time.

> [!warning]
> For working with `engine` you will also need to clone the curriculum repository so they are side by side.

### Lesson Standards
If you are writing a new lesson:
* Start with a clear learning objective.
* Use the `<InteractivePython>` component at least once per page for hands-on practice.
* Ensure the code examples are compatible with Python 3 (Skulpt's current implementation).
* Check out curriculum repository for more information or join us on Discord

### Code Style
* We use **Prettier** for formatting. Please run `npm run format` before submitting a PR.
* React components should follow functional patterns and use hooks.
